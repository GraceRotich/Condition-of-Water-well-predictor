This is a machine learning project with models that predict the condition of water wells in Tanzania.

## Business Understanding
According to Water.org(2024), Tanzania faces a significant water and sanitation crisis, out of its population of 65 million people, 58 million people (88% of the population) lack access to safe water. People living under these circumstances, particularly women and girls, spend a significant amount of time traveling long distances to collect water. And other challenges like underfunding of planned government projects, population growth, and extreme weather events due to climate change create challenges for those living in poverty. Now more than ever access to safe water at home is critical to families in Tanzania

The project's main goal is to create a model for forecasting operational conditions of water points in Tanzania. With accurate predictions showing whether a water point will be working, broken, or under repair, the Tanzanian government will improve maintenance decision-making procedures, thereby making sure that communities have sustainable access to drinking water.

These are what the government of Tanzania can achieve from this;

* It will be able to improve the lifespan of water wells operationally.
* It can ensure more communities have a dependable source of clean drinking water.
* It can be sure that public funds and resources work best by identifying which boreholes should be given the  first priority during maintenance based on their neediness levels.
